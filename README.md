# 🦠 Adaptyv Nipah Benchmark

**Repredicting and Benchmarking Nipah Binder Designs**

This repository contains computational analysis and model comparison for designs submitted to the [Adaptyv Nipah Binder Competition](https://adaptyv.bio), which targets Nipah Virus.

## Overview
- Repredicting all submitted binder designs using AF3
- Comparing scoring behavior across different computational models (Boltz 2 vs AF3)
- Disclaimer: Single-sequence mode for binder; results may not be optimal for non-de novo proteins.
