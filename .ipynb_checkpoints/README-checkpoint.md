🦠 Adaptyv Nipah Benchmark
Repredicting and Benchmarking Nipah Binder Designs

This repository contains the computational analysis and model comparison for designs submitted to the Adaptyv Nipah Binder Competition, which targets the highly lethal Nipah Virus Glycoprotein G (NiV-G).

Our goal is to build a transparent, reproducible benchmark dataset by re-predicting all submitted binder designs using modern structure prediction frameworks and comparing their scoring behavior across models.
